# Operation Mode

The careful selection of the appropriate operation mode at the beginning of experiment planning is crucial, as it significantly influences reaction conditions, reaction kinetics, and ultimately, product quality. Considering parameters such as substrate concentrations, reaction times, and temperature within the relevant mode allows for optimal reaction control, directly impacting the efficiency and purity of the final product. Furthermore, choosing a scalable mode not only facilitates potential upscaling of the reaction but also streamlines resource management, contributing to overall process efficiency.

### Batch

The batch operation mode represents a fundamental approach in biocatalysis, where all reaction components are mixed simultaneously within a closed system, and the reaction proceeds until a predetermined endpoint is reached. This mode is easy to control and well-suited for producing small batches of products.

### Fed-Batch

In the fed-batch operation mode, additional substances or reagents are gradually introduced during the reaction to control reaction conditions or enhance product formation. This mode allows better control of the reaction progress and can increase productivity.

    - Type: string

### Continuous

In the continuous operation mode, the reaction operates continuously with substrates continuously supplied and products continuously removed. This mode enables uniform product formation and is particularly suitable for large-scale production.

### CombinatorialMode

A combinatorial mode does not clearly fit into any of the aforementioned subcategories and thus represents a blend of operation modes.
