# Welcome to STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines

STRENDA biocatalysis is aiming to define which ATTRIBUTES should be used to describe an experiment in biocatalysis. Since biocatalysis is a discipline with many different operational modes, it is very overwhelming to hand out one document to describe all possible experimental setups. On the contrary, we need a catalog that adapts to the experimental procedures to help experimenters in their everyday work and give software developers a basis for data modeling. For this reason, we subdivided the whole catalog into six main CATEGORIES and built it in an adaptive modular way. This version of the catalog primarily focuses on metadata related to transformation. Additional aspects such as product purification, analytics, and other experimental processes may not be fully captured and covered yet.

On this website, the ATTRIBUTES (metadata) are organised in these six main CATEGORIES which are visualised as icons below. Please click on the icons to open the next level and review the ATTRIBUTES.

# CATEGORIES and ATTRIBUTES

## Operation mode

The operation mode is the first step in the experimental planning, it describes the mode in which the experiment was performed (e.g. batch, fed-batch, continuous)

## Vessel type and mixing (hydrodynamics)

When discussing enzymatic reactions, it's essential to address the vessel type and its influence on mixing and hydrodynamics.

## (Bio)catalyst

Closely examining the role of the biocatalyst is a fundamental aspect in the context of enzymatic reactions.

## Components

Exploring the components involved in the reaction mixture is essential for a comprehensive understanding of enzymatic reactions.

## Reaction conditions

Examining the reaction conditions provides critical insights into the enzymatic reaction process.

## Sampling

Understanding the sampling process is crucial for obtaining reliable data in enzymatic studies.
