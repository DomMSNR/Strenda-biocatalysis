# Welcome to STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines

Biocatalysis, at the intersection of biology and chemistry, has become as a powerful tool in modern research and industry, driving innovation across various fields. Systematic documentation of enzymatic reactions is essential not only for a better understanding of enzymatic processes but also for exploiting their potential in practical applications.

Welcome to the STRENDA Biocatalysis Online Catalog, a comprehensive resource for the standardized collection of enzymatic reaction metadata. At a time when data management and reproducibility are of paramount importance, STRENDA provides a framework that aligns with the state-of-the-art in biocatalysis research. 

This catalog offers researchers and scientists in the field of biocatalysis a structured platform to access and contribute metadata crucial for understanding enzymatic transformations. STRENDA biocatalysis aims to define which ATTRIBUTES should be used to describe an experiment in biocatalysis. Since biocatalysis is a discipline with many different operational modes, it can be overwhelming to provide one document that describes all possible experimental setups. On the contrary, there is a need for a catalog that adapts to the experimental procedures to assist experimenters in their everyday work and provide software developers with a basis for data modeling. For this reason, the entire catalog is subdivided into six main CATEGORIES and is built in an adaptive modular way. While the primary focus remains on enzymatic transformations themselves, the broader landscape of biocatalysis, including aspects such as product purification, analytics, and experimental processes, is also acknowledged. These complementary aspects of biocatalysis, though essential, are not within the scope of this first version of the STRENDA Biocatalysis guidelines.

Feel free to explore the valuable information in this catalog and join in standardizing enzymatic reaction data. Following the STRENDA guidelines and using the latest knowledge in biocatalysis helps us all move forward in this exciting field. On this website, the ATTRIBUTES (metadata) are organised in these six main CATEGORIES which are visualised as icons below. Please click on the icons to open the next level and review the ATTRIBUTES.

## How to use STRENDA biocatalysis

- use [this]() tool to define your ATTRIBUTES set


# CATEGORIES and ATTRIBUTES

## Operation mode

The operation mode is the first step in the experimental planning, it describes the mode in which the experiment was performed (e.g. batch, fed-batch, continuous)

## Vessel type and mixing (hydrodynamics)

When discussing enzymatic reactions, it's essential to address the vessel type and its influence on mixing and hydrodynamics.

## (Bio)catalyst

Closely examining the role of the biocatalyst is a fundamental aspect in the context of enzymatic reactions.
