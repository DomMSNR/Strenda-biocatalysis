# Welcome to STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines

STRENDA biocatalysis is aiming to define which ATTRIBUTES should be used to describe an experiment in biocatalysis. Since biocatalysis is a dicipline with many different operational modes, it is not possible to hand out one catalogue to describe all possible experimental setups. On the contrary, we need a catalogue that adapts to the experimental procedures to help experimenters in their everyday work and give software developers a basis for data modelling. Therefore, STRENDA biocatalysis is build in a adaptive modular way.

On this website, you will find the ATTRIBUTES organised in six main CATEGORIES.

## How to use STRENDA biocatalysis

- use [this]() tool to define your ATRRIBUTES set


# Here, you can find our CATEGORIES and ATTRIBUTES

## Operation mode

The operation mode is the first step in the experimental planning, it describes the mode in which the experiment was perform (e.g. batch, fed-batch, continuous)
