# Welcome to Strenda biocatalysis guidelines

Strenda biocatalysis is aiming to define which Attributes should be used to describe an experiment in biocatalysis. Since biocatalysis is a dicipline with many different applications, it is not possible to hand out one catalogue to describe all experiments. On the contrary, it should be the catalog that adapts to the experiments. Therefore, strenda-biocatalysis is build as modular system

On this website, you will find the specifications and the backbone of the modular system 

## How to use strenda biocatalysis

- use [this]() tool to define your metadata set


# Here, you can find our categories and attributes

## OperationMode

The operation mode is the first step in the experimental planning, it describes the mode in which the experiment was perform (e.g. batch, fedbatch, continuous)
