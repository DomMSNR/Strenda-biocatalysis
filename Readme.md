# Welcome to Strenda biocatalysis guidelines

Strenda biocatalysis is aiming to define which Attributes should be used to describe an experiment in biocatalysis. Since biocatalysis is a dicipline with many different applications, it is not possible to hand out one catalogue to describe all experiments. On the contrary, it should be the catalog that adapts to the experiments. Therefore, strenda-biocatalysis is build as modular system
